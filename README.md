# Python Distlink - MOID computation
This is a Python wrapper for the C++ library `distlink` published by R.V. Baluev and D.V. Mikryukov used to 
compute the **minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID)** of two orbits described by classical Kepler elements.
Their original C++ library is unmodified and lies in the `distlink-2.0` subdirectory. 
Please refer to [the authors' README file](distlink-2.0/README.txt) for more information. 
The original code is published [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/distlink/).
